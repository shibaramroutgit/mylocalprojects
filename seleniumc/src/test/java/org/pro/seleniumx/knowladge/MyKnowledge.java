    /** Selenium 3 vs Selenium 4
     *   In Selenium 3 - client (Java Editor machine) communicate to server (Exe Browser) using JSON protocol
     *  then Browser Exe convert to W3C protocol to communicate real browser
     *  After operation on browser response process back by W3 Protocol to JSON protocol to communicate back to java client
     *  -- Due to this convert , it is slow
     *
     *  In Selenium 4 - client (Java Editor machine) communicate to server (Exe Browser) using W3C protocol
     *  then Browser Exe convert to W3C protocol to communicate real browser
     *  After operation on browser response process back by W3 protocol
     *  -- No convert on protocol so it faster

     /**WebDriver Interface
     * Implemented Class of WebDriver Interface
     * # Chrome Driver # Firefox Driver # Internet Explore Driver # RemoteWebDriver # ChromiumDriver
     * By inheritance concept super class can hold child class object so WebDriver obj can hold any browser object
     * We do so in common because to validate multi browser operation we need a reference when we can hold any browser object
