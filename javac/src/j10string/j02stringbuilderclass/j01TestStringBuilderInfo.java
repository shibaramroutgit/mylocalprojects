	// String is a class in java
	// String class implements "Serializable" interface
	// String object is immutable- it means once object create we cannot modify. if we do modify it create a new object with new modify data
	// To make mutable string object java introduce "StringBuffer" and "StringBuilder" class
	// String and StringBuffer object are thread safe but StringBuilder object not thread safe
	// toString() method is override in String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder, so object return the data of object not the address of object
	// equals() method override on String Class not in StringBuffer and StringBuilder
	// reverse() method present on StringBuffer and StringBuilder but not present in String Class
	// delete() method present on StringBuffer and StringBuilder but not present in String Class
	// String Class we can create object by String Literal and with new operator 
	// StringBuffer and StringBuilder we can create object by new operator
